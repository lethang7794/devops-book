# Chapter 8: How to Secure Communication, Storage, and Authentication

Data is one of the biggest asset of your company.

A secure networking is the first layer of defense for your company's data, (system & business secret).

But it's important to have more layers of defense for your data, via:

- **Secure communication**:

  Protect your data from unauthorized snooping, interference while it travels over the network, with:

  - Encryption-in-transit
  - Secure transport protocols: TLS, SSH, IPSec...

- **Secure storage**:

  Protect your data from unauthorized snooping, interference while it's in the storage, with:

  - Encryption-at-rest
  - Secrets management
  - Password storage
  - Key management

This chapter will walk you through a several hand-on examples about secure data:

- Encrypt data with AES, RSA
- Verify file integrity with SHA-256, HMAC, digital signatures
- Store secrets with AWS Secrets Manager
- Serve your apps over HTTPs, by setting up TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt

## Cryptography Primer


> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #1
>
> Don’t roll your own cryptography: always use mature, battle-tested, proven algorithms and implementations.

### Encryption

### Hashing

## Secure Storage

### Secrets Management

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #2
>
> Do not store secrets as plaintext.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #3
>
> Avoid storing secrets whenever possible by using SSO, 3rd party services, or just not storing the data at all.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #4
>
> Protect personal secrets, such as passwords and credit card numbers, by storing them in a password manager.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #5
>
> Protect infrastructure secrets, such as database passwords and TLS certificates, by using a KMS and/or a general-purpose secret store.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #6
>
> Never store user passwords (encrypted or otherwise). Instead, use a password hash function to compute a hash of each password with a salt and pepper, and store those hash values.

### Encryption at Rest

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #7
>
> You can encrypt data at rest using full-disk encryption, data store encryption, and application-level encryption.

## Secure Communication

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #8
>
> You can encrypt data in transit using TLS. You get a TLS certificate from a certificate authority.

### Example: HTTPS with LetsEncrypt and AWS Secrets Manager

### End-to-End Encryption

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Key takeaway #9
>
> Use end-to-end encryption to protect data so that no one other than the intended recipients can see it—not even the software provider.
